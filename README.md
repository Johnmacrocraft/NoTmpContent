Automatically clean the tmp folder in PocketMine-MP for Android!

## How to use
Just drop this plugin into your plugins folder. It will automatically clean the tmp folder on server shutdown.

## Where to use
This plugin should support any app that is capable of running PocketMine-MP on Android, but I cannot guarantee that it will work with all apps.
